# PyBer_Analysis
This is assignment 5

## Overview of the analysis:

I was hired as Data Scientist to help PyBer CEO understand how their ride-sharing business works. Specifically the CEO wants to know how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results:

There are 125 rides in Rural Cities, 625 in Suburban and 1625 rides in Urban cities. The total number of drivers in rural, Suburban and Urban cities are 537, 8570 and 59602 consecutively.
an average fare in Rural cities is the largest of all and is 34.62 dollars wheas this ammount for Suburban and Urban cities are 30.97 and 24.53 consecutively. 
average fare per driver in the Urban cities are the lowest and Rural is the largest.

For further summary statistics you may refer to the table in section 8 of the challenge code.

We then analyzed the total fare per city type in each month to find where our highest margin is coming from.

Although we charge higher fares in Rural cities, since we do not have a lot of rides, the total fare in those city types are the smallest of all throughout the year.

Our overal fare is in its pick during the month of April, as we had the highest fare in all three city types during that month. 


## Summary:

In summary, we see the three city types act differently in terms of all aspects, such as fare amount, driver numbers and the number of rides per city type. Throughout the year also these differences is seen.

Overall, the Urban cities are the main source of income for our company and we need to maintain the number of drivers to address the number of ride needs in those city types. 

During some months we see a decline in the the total fare on each city types. further analysis is needed to see if the number of rides declined or if we charge less during those months/weeks.
